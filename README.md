# Dinner Club üçΩÔ∏è‚ú®üéâ
Welcome to the repository for Dinner Club! This is a project I worked on during August/September of 2024 to build excitement and engagement for an event I was hosting with two of my close friends - it was a ton of fun to work on!

In essence, Dinner Club was an idea we had a few years back to host an insanely over-the-top dinner for our friends. We hosted our first Dinner club in October `23, and it was a huge success! For 2024, we wanted to make it _even more_ exciting, so we decided to create a website with a countdown timer and a series of puzzles that would culminate in a final reveal of the official invitation.

## Tech Stack
The Dinner Club website was created using an Angular frontend backed Google Firebase for hosting coupled with a firestore database. The website was designed to be fully responsive and mobile-friendly, and the puzzles were designed to be challenging but solvable with a bit of thought and creativity. Route guarding was implemented to prevent participants from skipping, and javascript code was obfuscated to minimize code analysis.

Firebase functions were also used to send WhatsApp messages to myself and the other 2 hosts as participants progressed through the stages. This was done to ensure that we could monitor progress and provide hints if necessary.

## Try it out!
If you want to see the website or simply put your puzzle-solving skills to the test, you can check out the website at [https://dinner-club.org](https://dinner-club.org). 

**IMPORTANT**:
Note that we we initially gave each participant a unique invitation, each of which is necessary to solve the puzzles. The invitations can be viewed on Canva [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGOO6MNXqo/23TBZz9fK10qLPsEoFX0Ug/view?utm_content=DAGOO6MNXqo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor).

**DISCLAIMER**: Note that stages 3 and 5 required participants to go to a physical location. The physical object planted are no longer there, so you will need to use the hints provided in the puzzle solutions to solve these stages.

## Puzzle Hints / Solutions

### Stage 1:
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
You might need to take a look at the letters on the <a href='https://www.canva.com/design/DAGOO6MNXqo/23TBZz9fK10qLPsEoFX0Ug/view?utm_content=DAGOO6MNXqo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor'>Canva invites</a> for this one.

<details>
<summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
The words on the left side of each invite will spell out the Bible verse John 7:37b (ESV): "If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink." If the buttons corresponding to each invite are pressed in the order of the verse, the next stage will be revealed.

The solution can be solved to yield two numbers which are coordinates to a location. Originally, this location had a QR code that would advance to the next stage.

### Stage 4:
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
What could the phrase be referencing?
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Given that the phrase is part of the song "Call Me Maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen, maybe solution is related to the song.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
What could the number on the invite be used for?
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
The phrase is an excerpt from the song "Call Me Maybe" If the phone number on the invite is called, a voicemail with a few cooking ingredients will be played. These ingredients together form a recipe for chicken pot pie, which is the solution to this stage.

### Stage 5:
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
What book is that?
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Can you figure out where this picture was taken?
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
This photo is a picture of the book "Julia & Julia" taken at Grapevine Public Library. Originally, if participants went to the library and found the book, it woulc contain an image of Julia Child's famous beef bourguignon recipe. The final QR code would be in a nearby Julia Child cookbook that would lead to the invite.
